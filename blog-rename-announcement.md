# Introducing Massimo: The Next Evolution of Type-Safe API Client Generation

Today marks a significant milestone in the evolution of type-safe API development. What began as **@platformatic/client** in our [v0.19.0 release](https://blog.platformatic.dev/its-platformatic-client-time-in-the-v0190-release) has grown into something much bigger‚Äîa production-proven, enterprise-grade solution now powering companies like [Spendesk](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230929251750/en/Spendesk-Adopts-Platformatic-to-Enhance-Backend-Development-Efficiency), who are not only using Massimo in production but actively contributing to its development.

We're thrilled to introduce **Massimo** (formerly @platformatic/client)‚Äînot just a new name, but the next evolution of type-safe API client generation. This relaunch also marks Massimo's independence as standalone packages without the @platformatic scope. 

## Why "Massimo"?

The name is inspired by [Massimo Troisi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_Postino:_The_Postman), the beloved Italian actor from the film "Il Postino" (The Postman). Just as the postman in the movie delivered messages and connected people, Massimo delivers API connections and bridges the gap between services, making communication between applications as effortless and poetic as Troisi's unforgettable performance.

## From Prototype to Production

Since its initial release, what started as a developer tool has evolved into an enterprise-grade solution. Massimo has been battle-tested in production environments, with companies like Spendesk relying on it to enhance their backend development efficiency. This real-world usage has driven continuous improvements, community contributions, and the robust feature set you see today.

## Complete Feature Overview

Massimo is a powerful API SDK client and CLI tool for creating fully-typed clients for remote [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) or [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) APIs. Here's everything you need to know about its comprehensive, production-proven feature set:

### üöÄ Core Features

### üì¶ Client Library Features

The `massimo` core library offers programmatic API access:

**OpenAPI Client Builder**
```javascript
import { buildOpenAPIClient } from "massimo";

const client = await buildOpenAPIClient({
  url: 'https://api.example.com/openapi.json',
  headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer token' },
  validateResponse: true,
  fullResponse: false,
  throwOnError: true
});
```

**GraphQL Client Builder**
```javascript
import { buildGraphQLClient } from "massimo";

const client = await buildGraphQLClient({
  url: 'https://api.example.com/graphql',
  headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer token' }
});

const result = await client.graphql({
  query: 'mutation { createUser(input: { name: "John" }) { id } }',
  variables: { name: "John" }
});
```

### üîß Authentication & Security Features

**Dynamic Headers**
- Support for dynamic header generation via `getHeaders` function
- Request-specific authentication token handling
- Context-aware header modification

**Fastify Plugin Authentication**
```javascript
app.configureMyClient({
  async getHeaders(req, reply) {
    return {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${req.user.token}`,
      'X-User-ID': req.user.id
    };
  }
});
```

**Security Options**
- Custom header configuration for protected endpoints
- Support for various authentication schemes (Bearer, API Key, etc.)
- CORS credentials handling for browser clients

### üåê Two Client Types: Server vs Frontend

Massimo generates two fundamentally different types of clients depending on your target environment:

#### **Server-Side Clients ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)/[Fastify](https://fastify.dev/))**
Built on **[Undici](https://undici.nodejs.org/)** for maximum performance and Node.js compatibility:

```bash
# Generate server-side client (default)
massimo http://api.example.com/openapi.json --name myclient
```

**Key Features:**
- Uses [Undici](https://undici.nodejs.org/) [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) client for optimal Node.js performance
- Built-in connection pooling and [HTTP/2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP_2) support
- Advanced timeout controls (body timeout, headers timeout)
- Custom dispatchers and agents for fine-tuned control
- Full telemetry and tracing integration
- Designed for high-throughput server applications

```javascript
// Server-side client usage
import myClient from './myclient/myclient.js';

const client = await myClient({
  url: 'https://api.example.com',
  bodyTimeout: 30000,
  headersTimeout: 10000,
  dispatcher: customAgent // Custom Undici agent
});

// Works seamlessly in Fastify
app.get('/users', async (request) => {
  return request.myclient.getUsers(); // Automatic telemetry propagation
});
```

#### **Frontend Clients (Browser/Fetch)**
**Zero dependencies** - uses native browser [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API):

```bash
# Generate frontend client
massimo http://api.example.com/openapi.json --frontend --name myclient
```

**Key Features:**
- **No external dependencies** - pure [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)/[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Uses native browser [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API
- Optimized bundle size for frontend applications
- Support for [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) credentials and browser security policies
- Works in any [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) environment with fetch support

```javascript
// Frontend client - two usage patterns available

// Pattern 1: Named operations with global state
import { setBaseUrl, getMovies, setDefaultHeaders } from './api.js';

setBaseUrl('https://api.example.com');
setDefaultHeaders({ Authorization: 'Bearer token' });
const movies = await getMovies({}); // Uses global config

// Pattern 2: Factory approach (isolated instances)
import build from './api.js';

const client = build('https://api.example.com', {
  headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer token' }
});
const movies = await client.getMovies({}); // Self-contained
```

**Bundle Impact:**
- Server client: Includes Undici (~200KB) for performance
- Frontend client: **Zero dependencies** - only your generated code (~5-10KB)

This architectural difference means you can use the same OpenAPI spec to generate both a high-performance server client for your backend services AND a lightweight, dependency-free client for your frontend applications!

### üèóÔ∏è Advanced Features

**Operation Mapping**
- Access to OpenAPI operation ID mappings via symbol properties
- Method and path inspection for debugging and tooling

**Request/Response Customization**
- Custom query parameter parsing
- Request body and header modification
- Full response object access when needed
- Response validation against OpenAPI schemas

**Telemetry & Monitoring**
- Automatic telemetry propagation in Fastify environments
- Request tracing and performance monitoring
- Built-in error handling with detailed error codes

**Error Handling**
Comprehensive error system with specific error codes:
- `PLT_MASSIMO_OPTIONS_URL_REQUIRED` - Missing URL in client options
- `PLT_MASSIMO_FORM_DATA_REQUIRED` - FormData required for multipart requests
- `PLT_MASSIMO_MISSING_PARAMS_REQUIRED` - Missing required path parameters
- `PLT_MASSIMO_INVALID_RESPONSE_SCHEMA` - Response validation failure
- And more detailed error scenarios for robust error handling

### üè¢ Enterprise Adoption & Community

**Production Usage**
Companies like Spendesk are using Massimo to power their production applications, demonstrating its reliability and enterprise readiness. The feedback and contributions from these production deployments have been instrumental in shaping Massimo's evolution.
