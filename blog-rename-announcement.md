# Introducing Massimo: The Next Evolution of Type-Safe API Client Generation

Today marks a significant milestone in the evolution of type-safe API development. What began as **@platformatic/client** in our [v0.19.0 release](https://blog.platformatic.dev/its-platformatic-client-time-in-the-v0190-release) has grown into something much bigger‚Äîa production-proven, enterprise-grade solution now powering companies like [Spendesk](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230929251750/en/Spendesk-Adopts-Platformatic-to-Enhance-Backend-Development-Efficiency), who are not only using Massimo in production but actively contributing to its development.

We're thrilled to introduce **Massimo** (formerly @platformatic/client)‚Äînot just a new name, but the next evolution of type-safe API client generation. This relaunch also marks Massimo's independence as standalone packages without the @platformatic scope. 

## Why "Massimo"?

The name is inspired by [Massimo Troisi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_Postino:_The_Postman), the beloved Italian actor from the film "Il Postino" (The Postman). Just as the postman in the movie delivered messages and connected people, Massimo delivers API connections and bridges the gap between services, making communication between applications as effortless and poetic as Troisi's unforgettable performance.

## From Prototype to Production

Since its initial release, what started as a developer tool has evolved into an enterprise-grade solution. Massimo has been battle-tested in production environments, with companies like Spendesk relying on it to enhance their backend development efficiency. This real-world usage has driven continuous improvements, community contributions, and the robust feature set you see today.

## Complete Feature Overview

Massimo is a powerful API SDK client and CLI tool for creating fully-typed clients for remote OpenAPI or GraphQL APIs. Here's everything you need to know about its comprehensive, production-proven feature set:

massimo http://api.example.com/openapi.json --name myclient

# Generate GraphQL client  
massimo http://api.example.com/graphql --name myclient --type graphql

# Frontend-compatible client
massimo http://api.example.com/openapi.json --frontend --language ts --name myclient

# Types only generation
massimo http://api.example.com/openapi.json --types-only --name myclient
```

**Advanced CLI Options**
- `--frontend` - Generate browser-compatible clients using `fetch`
- `--language js|ts` - Choose JavaScript or TypeScript output
- `--full-response` - Return complete response objects instead of just body
- `--full-request` - Wrap parameters in `body`, `headers`, `query` structure
- `--validate-response` - Enable response validation against schema

- `--typescript` - Generate TypeScript plugin files
- `--with-credentials` - Add credentials support for CORS requests

### üì¶ Client Library Features

The `massimo` core library offers programmatic API access:

**OpenAPI Client Builder**
```javascript
import { buildOpenAPIClient } from "massimo";

const client = await buildOpenAPIClient({
  url: 'https://api.example.com/openapi.json',
  headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer token' },
  validateResponse: true,
  fullResponse: false,
  throwOnError: true
});
```

**GraphQL Client Builder**
```javascript
import { buildGraphQLClient } from "massimo";

const client = await buildGraphQLClient({
  url: 'https://api.example.com/graphql',
  headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer token' }
});

const result = await client.graphql({
  query: 'mutation { createUser(input: { name: "John" }) { id } }',
  variables: { name: "John" }
});
```

### üîß Authentication & Security Features

**Dynamic Headers**
- Support for dynamic header generation via `getHeaders` function

    return {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${req.user.token}`,
      'X-User-ID': req.user.id
    };
  }
});
```

**Security Options**
- Custom header configuration for protected endpoints
- Support for various authentication schemes (Bearer, API Key, etc.)
- CORS credentials handling for browser clients

### üåê Frontend & Browser Support

**Frontend Client Generation**

import { setBaseUrl, getMovies, setDefaultHeaders } from './api.js';

setBaseUrl('https://api.example.com');
setDefaultHeaders({ Authorization: 'Bearer token' });
const movies = await getMovies({});

// Factory approach
import build from './api.js';

const client = build('https://api.example.com', {
  headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer token' }
});
const movies = await client.getMovies({});
```
